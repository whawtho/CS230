Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was The Gaming Room, a company looking for software for one of their games. They wanted a design that could work on different platforms and support multiple users.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I kept the documentation clear and easy to follow, explaining the main parts of the system and how they work together.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Planning the design before coding helped me stay organized and made it easier to understand what I needed to do.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would add more details to the requirements to make sure the design fully meets the client’s needs.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I used the client’s requests to guide the design. Considering user needs helps make sure the software is useful and works well for them.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I broke the system into smaller parts and used simple diagrams to plan it out. In the future, I’d keep using these strategies and get more feedback to improve the design.
