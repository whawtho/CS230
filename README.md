The Gaming Room Client and Their Software Requirements
The client was The Gaming Room, a company looking for software for one of their games. They wanted a design that could work on different platforms and support multiple users.

What I Did Well
I kept the documentation clear and easy to follow, explaining the main parts of the system and how they work together.

Helpful Parts of the Design Process
Planning the design before coding helped me stay organized and made it easier to understand what I needed to do.

What I Would Improve
I would add more details to the requirements to make sure the design fully meets the client’s needs.

Interpreting User Needs
I used the client’s requests to guide the design. Considering user needs helps make sure the software is useful and works well for them.

My Approach to Software Design
I broke the system into smaller parts and used simple diagrams to plan it out. In the future, I’d keep using these strategies and get more feedback to improve the design.
